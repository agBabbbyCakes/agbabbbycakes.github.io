## Ideas
- all these protocols - everything working at the same time

picturing

- real fake human

- everything has to play in a sandbox 

- individual humans are playing with AI with chaosnet all at the same time 

- sped up of using different applications - and it chaotically switches out of them 

# examples of applications
- load uniswap
- make it work in 10 seconds

uniswap - icon bot - 
# chaos in box
- chain link


the bot is using the website - much faster than you are
there are hundreds of these things - using the website 


# story 

- uniswap

- polygon



# real fake people 

# game play footage
- curve
- uniswap
- compound 
- defi llama


# script 
They already know what chaosnet is - we're just showing gameplay footage 
WHAT WE WANT TO SAY = try now -
