		<div>Ape is for the little space gorilla inside all of us.
</div>
		<div>Start</div>
		<div>Skip Story</div>
		<div>I don’t know what it is about space - but i’ve always wanted to go.
</div>
		<div>next</div>
		<div>float around some stars

do some backflips off some space station

discover new stars

reclaim old ones

find a little planet and settle

offer a service - start a lemonade stand

count some stars

collect some data

share some findings with the world back home

you know, space stuff
</div>
		<div>Next</div>
		<div>
I knew what I wanted.
But I hadn’t got a clue
on how to get there.
</div>
		<div>So I went to school.


but no one at school - was really doing anything


I mean, certainly there was a lot of talk

lot of dissertations

lot of theory

which was great…
i suppose



but still
it was just a bunch of chit chat



I wanted action.
I wanted to explore.
I wanted to know more.



I wanted to build rockets
and get to motherfucking space.









</div>
		<div>so alone
and lonely
oh
so lonely
but then one day
I found out


</div>
		<div>i would tinker and tinker and tinker and tinker and tinker for days
</div>
		<div>I felt alone
it seemed I was the only one
who wanted to build rockets
</div>
		<div>I wasn’t alone.
</div>

	</div>
